// This is just for verification purposes

// Test scenarios that should trigger missing data responses:

const testQueries = [
  // Scenario 1: Asking for specific vegetable prices that might be unavailable
  "Show me potato prices in Punjab",
  "What are the tomato rates in Maharashtra today?", 
  "Brinjal market rates in Tamil Nadu",
  
  // Scenario 2: Asking for uncommon/specialty crops
  "Asparagus prices in Delhi",
  "Lettuce farming rates in Kerala",
  
  // Scenario 3: General queries that should show suggested questions
  "Tell me about farming",
  "I need agricultural help",
  "What should I do?",
  
  // Scenario 4: Queries asking for unavailable location data
  "Weather in some remote area",
  "Market prices in unknown district"
];

console.log("Test queries that should demonstrate missing data handling:");
testQueries.forEach((query, index) => {
  console.log(`${index + 1}. "${query}"`);
});

console.log("\nExpected behaviors:");
console.log("1. Market Prices section should ALWAYS be visible");
console.log("2. Missing data should show transparent warning messages");
console.log("3. Alternative crops should be suggested when specific crop unavailable");
console.log("4. Suggested questions should be provided when context insufficient");
console.log("5. Query should appear as bold heading in response");
